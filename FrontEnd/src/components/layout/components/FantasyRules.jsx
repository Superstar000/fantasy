                    Assist points awarded by Opta within Fantasy Premier League
                    are calculated using additional stats which may differ from

                    For the avoidance of doubt, points awarded in-game are
                    subject to change up until one hour after the final whistle
                    of the last match of any given day. Once the points have all
                    been updated on that day, no further adjustments to points
                    will be made.

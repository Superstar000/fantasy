                data which you do submit will be processed in accordance with
                the Premier League's Privacy Policy, which can be found here:
                https://www.premierleague.com/privacy-policy and in accordance
                with relevant data protection legislation including the General
                Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and the Data Protection Act
                2018.
              </p>
              <p>
                10. We will only share your data in accordance with our Privacy
                Policy and as set out in these Terms. Where a Player is a winner
                of a Prize, the winner's name may be published on the Site or
                App in accordance with clauses 27 and 28. The Premier League may
                also share your personal data if required to do so by a
                competent authority or court within the United Kingdom.
              </p>
              <p>
                11. Both UK and non-UK Players Registering for the Game will be
                automatically entered into a "Country League". A Country League
                is a mini-league consisting of Players from the same Country. In
                association with the official Premier League broadcaster in
                selected territories, the Premier League may choose (but will
                not guarantee) to offer a Prize to the overall winner of a
                Country League. The nature of the Prize and the countries
                selected for this purpose are at the sole discretion of the
                Premier League. Entry into a Country League is automatic but
                participation in no way obligates the Player to receive
                marketing communications from the Premier League or broadcaster
                unless otherwise indicated during Registration to the Site or
                App.
              </p>
              <p>
                12. Players (and Players on behalf of others and organisations)
                can establish mini-leagues in accordance with the Game Rules.
                The Premier League does not permit Players charging for entry to
                mini-leagues they have created, strongly encourages Players not
                to join such leagues and cannot be held responsible for their
                management or any loss suffered through Playersâ€™ involvement in
                such leagues. The Premier League reserves the right to suspend
                and delete Registrations of Players that charge entry to
                mini-leagues they have created.
              </p>

                by the Premier League ("Game Rules"). The Premier League
                reserves the right to alter, amend or supplement the Game Rules
                in its absolute discretion. You agree that no liability shall
                attach to the Premier League as a result of any such change and
                so are advised to check the Game Rules regularly. The Game Rules
                form part of these Terms and by Registering for the Game, you
                accept the Game Rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                14. The Premier League will be the sole decision-maker of any
                matter of interpretation of the Game Rules and any aspect of the
                content of, or playing of, the Game. The Premier League will not
                enter into correspondence relating to such matters and its
                decision as to any matter arising out of or in connection with
                the Game Rules including but not limited to the allocation of
                points to any Player and/or the award of any Prize and/or any
                ranking or league table shall be final and conclusive.

              <p>
                15. The Premier League may choose to award prizes in respect of
                the Game ("Prizes"). Such Prizes will be available at the
                discretion of the Premier League and in accordance with criteria
                set by it. The Premier League reserves the right to alter and
                amend the Prizes or the criteria for winning a Prize, where
                circumstances beyond its reasonable control require it to do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                16. Prizes are not transferable and are non-exchangeable. No
                cash alternative will be offered in any circumstances. The
                Premier League will make reasonable endeavours to accommodate
                any needs or requirements of Prize recipients and where a Prize
                includes travel or attendance at an event, the Premier League
                will seek to agree dates with the recipient. However, where the
                recipient is unavailable on the dates provided by the Premier
                League, the Prize may be forfeited, or another recipient
                selected.
              </p>
              <p>

                applicable) and parental or guardian consent must be obtained.
                Such consent must include confirmation that the parent/guardian
                consented to the Player's Entry to the Game, they consent to the
                Player being awarded a Prize and will accompany the Player
                during any travel connected to the Prize.

                33. The extent of the Premier League's responsibility to you has
                been determined in the context of the following:
              </p>
              <p>
                a) the Game is provided to you free of charge and on an "as is"
                basis;
              </p>
              <p>
                b) you are responsible for any action you do or do not take as a
                result of the Game and the information therein;

              </p>

                Game is available to you at all times, without faults and that
                the contents are correct and accurate, it cannot make any legal
                commitment to you that this will be the case.

              <p>
                35. Premier League reserves the right at any time to temporarily
                or permanently modify or discontinue the Game with or without
                prior notice (due to reasons outside its reasonable control). In
                the event that Premier League permanently discontinues the Game
                pursuant to this paragraph, you shall be released from your
                obligations to Premier League under these Terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                36. Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes Premier League's
                liability for (i) death or personal injury caused by our
                negligence; (ii) liability arising from fraud or fraudulent
                misrepresentation; or (iii) any other reason or by any cause

                prize including but not limited to the following types of loss
                which you may suffer as a result of your entry to the Game:

                when you first applied for the Game (even if that loss results

              <p>
                b) any business loss you may suffer, including loss of revenue,
                profits, or anticipated savings (whether those losses are the
                direct or indirect result of the Premier League's default);
              </p>
              <p>
                c) loss which you suffer other than as a result of our failure
                to comply with these Terms or our negligence or breach of
                statutory duty;
              </p>
              <p>
                d) any loss which you may suffer as a result of or in connection
                with or arising out of any Prize.

                under any other identity or team name. Any such decision by the

              </p>
              <p>
                41. If any of these Terms are determined to be illegal, invalid,
